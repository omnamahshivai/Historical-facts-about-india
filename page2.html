<!--About mahatma gandhi-->
<h2 class="heading">About The Father of Nation (Mahatma Gnadhi)</h2>
<center class="wrap"><img src="mahatma.jpg" alt="Mahatma gandhi" width="1280" height="750"></center>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi is remembered by many as a 20th-century symbol of non-violence. He was born in Porbandar, India, studied law, and organized boycotts against British institutions in peaceful forms of civil disobedience. Furthermore, he led India’s non-violent independence movement against British rule and advocated for the civil rights of Indians in South Africa during the apartheid era.<br>

    Gandhi’s advocacy for peaceful change was world revered. Despite this Gandhi died not having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, a prize awarded to individuals who have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the holding and promotion of peace congresses<br>
    
    <h3><b><i>Gandhi was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize several times but never won the award. Did the Nobel Committee know something that we didn’t?</i></b></h3><br>
    
    The Nobel Committee has subsequently expressed regret over not awarding Gandhi with the distinguished Nobel Peace Prize. But, was the Nobel Committee right in snubbing Gandhi the Nobel peace prize? This is the question this article aims to answer by revealing some of the less talked about traits that Gandhi exhibited throughout his life.<br>
