<h1 class ="ques"><center>WHAT IS HTML ?</center></h1>
<p class ="ans">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.HTML documents also contain anchors, 
which are tags that specify links to other Web pages. 
An anchor has the form <A HREF= “http://www.britannica.com”> Encyclopædia Britannica</A>, 
where the quoted string is the URL (universal resource locator) to which the link points (the Web “address”) 
and the text following it is what appears in a Web browser, underlined to show that it is a link to another page. 
What is displayed as a single page may also be formed from multiple URLs, some containing text and others graphics.</p>




<h1 class ="ques"><center>WHAT IS XML ?</center></h1>
<p class ="ans">XML, in full extensible markup language, a document formatting language used for some World Wide Web pages. 
XML began to be developed in the 1990s because HTML (hypertext markup language), the basic format for Web pages, 
does not allow the definition of new text elements; that is, it is not extensible. 
XML is a simplified form of SGML (standard generalized markup language) intended for documents that are published on the Web. 
Like SGML, XML uses DTDs (document type definitions) to define document types and the meanings of tags used in them. 
XML adopts conventions that make it easy to parse, such as that document entities are marked by both a beginning and an ending tag, 
such as <BEGIN>…</BEGIN>. XML provides more kinds of hypertext links than HTML, such as bidirectional links and links relative to a document subsection.</p>




<h1 class ="ques"><center>WHAT IS SGML ?</center></h1>
<p class ="ans">SGML, in full standard generalized markup language, an international computer standard for the definition of markup languages; 
that is, it is a metalanguage. Markup consists of notations called “tags,” which specify the function of a piece of text or how it is to be displayed. 
SGML emphasizes descriptive markup, in which a tag might be <emphasis>. 
Such a markup denotes the document function, and it could be interpreted as reverse video on a computer screen, 
underlining by a typewriter, or italics in typeset text.</p>


<h1 class ="ques"><center>WHAT IS MARKUP LANGUAGE ?</center></h1>
<p class ="ans">markup language, standard text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts. The most widely used markup languages are SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and XML (Extensible Markup Language). The markup symbols can be interpreted by a device (computer, printer, browser, etc.) to control how a document should look when printed or displayed on a monitor. A marked-up document thus contains two types of text: text to be displayed and markup language on how to display it.

<h1 class ="ques"><center>WHAT IS INFORMATION PROCESSING ?</center></h1>
<p class ="ans">In popular usage, the term information refers to facts and opinions provided and received during the course of daily life: one obtains information directly from other living beings, from mass media, from electronic data banks, and from all sorts of observable phenomena in the surrounding environment. A person using such facts and opinions generates more information, some of which is communicated to others during discourse, by instructions, in letters and documents, and through other media. Information organized according to some logical relationships is referred to as a body of knowledge, to be acquired by systematic exposure or study. Application of knowledge (or skills) yields expertise, and additional analytic or experiential insights are said to constitute instances of wisdom. Use of the term information is not restricted exclusively to its communication via natural language. Information is also registered and communicated through art and by facial expressions and gestures or by such other physical responses as shivering. Moreover, every living entity is endowed with information in the form of a genetic code. These information phenomena permeate the physical and mental world, and their variety is such that it has defied so far all attempts at a unified definition of information.

<h1 class ="ques"><center>GENERALCONSIDERATION ?</center></h1>
<div><h2 class ="toipic">Basic Concepts. </h2>
<p class ="ans">Interest in how information is communicated and how its carriers convey meaning has occupied, since the time of pre-Socratic philosophers, the field of inquiry called semiotics, the study of signs and sign phenomena. Signs are the irreducible elements of communication and the carriers of meaning. The American philosopher, mathematician, and physicist Charles S. Peirce is credited with having pointed out the three dimensions of signs, which are concerned with, respectively, the body or medium of the sign, the object that the sign designates, and the interpretant or interpretation of the sign. Peirce recognized that the fundamental relations of information are essentially triadic; in contrast, all relations of the physical sciences are reducible to dyadic (binary) relations. Another American philosopher, Charles W. Morris, designated these three sign dimensions syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic, the names by which they are known today.
