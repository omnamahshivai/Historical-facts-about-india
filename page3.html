            <p><b>Prime Ministership:</b> Nehru threatened revolt within congress in 1946 and risked jeopardizing Indian Independence if he was not selected as India’s PM.<br>
                Kashmir: Before the Indian army could drive the intruders from Kashmir back to Pakistan, Nehru promised plebiscite to resolve the Kashmir issue, resulting in India being not able to get POK back.<br>
                Indian-China Conflict: India was in a strong position to defend its interests in Tibet, but gave up the opportunity for the sake of pleasing China. It is not widely known in India that in 1950, China could have been prevented from taking over Tibet and thus avoiding the 1962 Indo-China war.<br>

                <br>
<br>

Refused Permanent Seat In UN For India: Nehru ‘declined a United States offer’ to India to ‘take the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council’ around 1953 and suggested that it be given to China, according to the United Nations Under-Secretary-General, Sashi Tharoor.

Bharat Ratna Quid Pro Quo: Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi received Bharat Ratna on the recommendations of the sitting presidents Rajendra Prasad and V.V.Giri whom they conferred ‘Bharat Ratna’ in return.
<br>
<br>

Betrayal Of Subash Chandra Bose: Nehru pressured the British to get Subash Chandra Bose arrested in Russia. Nehru called Subhash Chandra Bose as a ‘War criminal’
<br>
<br>

<b>Sanskrit:</b> Dr.Ambedkar and Professor Naziruddin Ahmed sponsored an amendment making Sanskrit as the official language of the Indian Union in place of Hindi. But the amendment was defeated in the Constituent Assembly due to the opposition of the ruling Congress Party under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.
<br>
<br>
He was a self-centered, egoist, narcissist, corrupt politician who loved his dominance to sustain and gave his extravagant way of living more priority than standing by his country when it needed the most. his selfish nature gave birth to many issues India is still facing:<br>
<br>
<br>

He used his power to pass article 306-A which ultimately became a source of article 370 giving special rights to Kashmir.<br>
India lost its chance to teach China a lesson in 1950 China Conflict because of his soft stance and allegiance to China. Shortly, after India's independence in 1947, the first commander-in-chief of the Indian armed forces, General Sir Robert Lockhart approached Pt. Nehru with a paper outlining a strategic plan for the growth of the Indian Army. On seeing the paper,<br>
Pt. Nehru replied, "We do not need a Defence plan. Our policy is ahimsa, non-violence. We foresee no military threats. Scrap the army! The police are good enough to meet our security needs."<br>

When Jinnah took away Pakistan and made it an Islamic Country he never argued for a Hindu sovereign country.
<br>

<br>
Many people know that the Main Cause of the Partition of India was Nehru. It is said that during India's independence Muhammad Ali Jinnah wants to become Prime Minister but Nehru refuses to leave the seat for prime minister. Due to this Jinnah announced a new country for Muslims if not able to become prime minister and thus Pakistan Born.
<br>

<br>
Jawaharlal Nehru became a widower at a very early age. This is a known fact and it is also known that Edwina Mountbatten, the wife of the last Viceroy shared a platonic friendship (which is confirmed by Edwina’s daughter Pamela Hicks in her book Daughter of Empire) with him. However, controversial talks say that the relationship was beyond the so-called “platonic relationship.

<br>

<br>
Nehru had a love affair with Sarojini Naidu’s daughter Padmaja Naidu, whom Nehru got appointed as the Governor of Bengal. It is revealed that he used to keep her portrait in his bedroom, which Indira would often remove. It caused some tension between father and daughter.
<br>

<br>
Government of India has not built a memorial of Jawaharlal Nehru at his birthplace 77 Mirganj in Allahabad, because it is a brothel. The entire locality is a well known red light area for long. It has not become a brothel recently, but it has been a brothel even before Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth. A portion of the same house was sold by his father Motilal Nehru to a prostitute named Lali Jaan and it came to be known as “Imambada”. Motilal Nehru along with his family later shifted to Anand Bhawan.
<br>

<br>
He also refused to join the UN offer of India’s permanent membership & gave this to China in 1950.
<br>
<br>

It was reportedly told that he was predicted as “Demon for the Country” by a monk when he was still in his mother’s womb. Once when Swaruprani was pregnant, the couple decided to take a holy dip in the Ganges. During this time, a monk saw the couple with great rage. When Motilal approached the monk, he said the child in the womb is a demon and if he is allowed to be born, he will disastrous to the country. He told Motilal that he should get away with the child even if that requires giving poison (her) to his wife

<h2 class="heading"><center><u>About Vedas</u></center></h2>
<center><img src="https://pparihar2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/vedas2.gif?w=547" alt="Vedas" width="720"></center>
<p>There are four types of Vedas – Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. One of the best sources of Ancient Indian History is Vedic literature. Vedas have formed the Indian scripture. The ideas and practices of Vedic religion are codified by the Vedas and they also form the basis of classical Hinduism.<br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subhead"><u>Rigveda</u></h3>
    <p>Rig Veda mainly contains various hymns for praying to Vedic Gods such as Agni (Fire God), Indra (The lord of Heavens), Mitra, Varuna (Water God), Surya (Sun God) etc. These hymns are called Riks. Hence the Veda is called Rik-Veda or RigVeda.<br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subhead"><u>Samveda</u></h3>
        <p>The Samaveda is the Veda of Chants, or "storehouse of knowledge of chants". According to Frits Staal, it is "the Rigveda set to music". It is a fusion of older melodies (sāman) and the Rig verses.<br>
            <br>
        </p>
<h3 class="subhead"><u>Yajurveda</u></h3>
<p>The white Yajur Veda deals with prayers and specific instructions for devotional sacrifices, whereas the black Yajur Veda deals with sacrificial rituals. The Vedas were originally transmitted by word of mouth, before being edited by various schools known as shakhas.<br>
    <br>
</p>
<h3 class="subhead"><u>Atharvaveda</u></h3>
<p>The Atharvaveda is a collection of 20 books, with a total of 730 hymns of about 6,000 stanzas. The text is, state Patrick Olivelle and other scholars, a historical collection of beliefs and rituals addressing practical issues of daily life of the Vedic society, and it is not a liturgical Yajurveda-style collection.<br>

    <h2 class="heading"><u><center>Science Behind These Four Vedas</center></u></h2>

<p>The credit for almost all the great inventions and discoveries so far has always rested with the Western world.  We have read about them in schoolbooks, heard about them on television or in movies and talked about it tirelessly. Sadly, it’s the knowledge and teaching of our ancient science that has taken a beating. Just because their achievements were well-documented, it doesn’t mean that they were the first ones to do that. Here are 10 facts, as found in our written and oral literature, about the supremely advanced ancient Indian science that you were never taught in school.<br>
    <br>

    <h3 class="subhead"><u>Sushruta Samhita, The Oldest Medical And Surgical Encyclopedia Known To Mankind</u></h3>
<center><img src="https://www.booksfact.com/images/science/ancient_science/susruta_shastras_instruments.jpg" alt="Equip" width="400"></center>
<p>Written during  the 6th century BC, the Sushruta Samhita contains 184 chapters with descriptions of 1,120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources. Its author Sushruta is also considered to be the first ever human to perform medical surgeries on humans. The book also has vast details on embryology, human anatomy, along with instructions for venesection, the positioning of the patient for each vein, and the protection of vital structures (marma). The oldest documented evidence (9000 years) for the drilling of human teeth of a living person was found in Mehrgarh along with the evidences of orthopedic surgeries.  <br>

    <h3 class="subhead"><u>The First Ones To Acknowledge The Existence Of The Solar System</u></h3>
    <p>While history credits Copernicus for proposing the heliocentric model of our solar system, it was the Rig Veda that first noted the central placement of the sun and other planets orbiting it in the solar system.<br>
    <br>    </p>
<center><img src="https://images.edexlive.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2021/10/18/original/sky-3880590_1280.jpeg?w=600&dpr=1.0" alt="solar system" width="720"></center>
<p><h5><u>Rig Veda 1.164.13</u></h5>
    “Sun moves in its orbit which itself is moving. Earth and other bodies move around sun due to force of attraction, because sun is heavier than them.”<br>
    <br>
    <p><h5><u>Rig Veda 1.35.9</u></h5>
        <p>“The sun moves in its own orbit but holding earth and other heavenly bodies in a manner that they do not collide with each other through force of attraction.”<br>
            <br>
        </p>
<h2 class="subhead"><u>Indian Vedas Figured Out Gravity Before The West Did</u></h2>
<center><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/101715_essay_opener_free.jpg" alt="Gravity" width="780"></center>
<p>Yet again, way before Isaac Newton explained gravity, ancient Indian scholars had already figured out how it worked.<br>
    <br>
    <h5><u>Rig Veda 10.22.14</u></h5>
    <P>“This earth is devoid of hands and legs, yet it moves ahead. All the objects over the earth also move with it. It moves around the sun.”<br>
    </P>
<center><h2 class="heading"><u>Vedas Explained The Science Behind The Rather ‘Feared’ Eclipses
</u></h2></center>
<center><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsDtpFEHbDpae6wBuW5wQo-970-80.jpg.webp" alt="Black hole" width="789"></center>
<p>While the world feared the eclipses and associated all types of paranormal occurrences with the phenomenon, Vedas already had a very proper and scientific explanation. The below excerpt is also proof that they knew that the moon wasn’t self illuminated.<br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="subhead"><u>Rig Veda 5.40.5</u></h3>   
    <p>“O Sun! When you are blocked by the one whom you gifted your own light (moon), then earth gets scared by sudden darkness.”
